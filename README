Why we deserve A?

Without any prior opengl we tried to make best out of the things you taught. We know it’s not the best but we learned a lot during this project and course.

What to see:
1. 3d Scene
1. The first scene is changing of seasons.
	a. First is summer with day
 	b. Next is rain with day where the trees and grass change to green
	c. Next is hail with fog and day
	d. Last is snow with fog and day, after hail, the snow formation can be seen.
The above season changes are automatic, they change after every period of time
after all the season changes, we showed the night view for the season changes.
Where you can find the difference in day and night scenes.

For user who want to see seasons seperately, we created views for the seasons.
2. The next view is Rain.
3. The next view is Hail.
4. The next view is snow.
5. The last view is summer.
2. Shadows:
We created shadows for all the objects including the moving cars, trees and all the objects. You can see that the shadows disappear when lights are off. 
3. Texturing:
We added good texturing to all objects.
4. The cycles that we created where there is no need of any user inputs and they are automatic.
5. Texturing and movement of the car.

We understood the code and changed it according to our scene and requirement.
